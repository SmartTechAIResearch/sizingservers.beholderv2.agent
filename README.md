# sizingservers.beholderv2.agent

**Development discontinued for now. It holds some ideas that might be useful for the future. For now, use sizingservers.beholder.agent.**  

The first beholder is somewhat simplistic: one could view resources in use and that's about it. 

This version of the API tries to use the exact same formatting of harware information for Linux and Windows machines both, for trying to track hardware as it moves around the datacenter.

However an API and Frontend does not exist and one wonders how meaningful this is when all hardware is virtual.
